A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. Examples of numerical palindromes are:

2332 
110011 
54322345
You'll be given 2 numbers as arguments: (num, s). Write a function which returns an array of s number of numerical palindromes that come after num. If num is a palindrome itself, it should be included in the count. 

Return "Not valid" instead if any one of the inputs is not a number or is less than 0.

Single digit numbers will NOT be considered numerical palindromes. 

console.log(palindrome(6,4));
// [11,22,33,44]
console.log(palindrome(75,1));
// [77]
console.log(palindrome(101,2));
// [101,111]
console.log(palindrome(20,0));
// []
console.log(palindrome(0,4));
// [11,22,33,44]

console.log(palindrome("ACCDDCCA",3));
// "Not valid"
console.log(palindrome(773,"1551"));
// "Not valid"
console.log(palindrome(-4505,15));
// "Not valid"
console.log(palindrome(4505,-15));
// "Not valid"





Consider the word "abode".
The letter `a` is in position 1 and `b` is in position 2.
In the alphabet, `a` and `b` are also in positions 1 and 2.

The letters `d` and `e` in "abode" occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5. 

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,

solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) // [4, 3, 1]

Input will consist of alphabetic characters, both uppercase and lowercase.  No spaces.
